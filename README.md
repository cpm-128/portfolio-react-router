## Description
A portfolio of my web development works to share with fellow developers, collaborate on future projects, apply for jobs, and showcase for freelancing. This portfolio is built using React.

### User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications,<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.
